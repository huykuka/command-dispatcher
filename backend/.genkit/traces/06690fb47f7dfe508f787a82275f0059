for data processing and alert generation (e.g., alert within X seconds of detection).\",\"System can handle the anticipated volume of sensor data and alerts without degradation in performance.\",\"System demonstrates high availability and fault tolerance through failure injection tests.\",\"Performance metrics (e.g., response times, throughput, resource utilization) are within acceptable thresholds.\",\"System maintains data integrity and consistency during periods of high load or transient failures.\"],\"description\":\"Measure the system's performance metrics, such as data throughput, processing latency, and alert delivery time, under various load conditions to ensure it meets non-functional requirements for speed, scalability, and resilience.\",\"userStory\":\"As a System Administrator, I want to ensure the system performs reliably under various loads so that users experience consistent service and critical events are processed without delay, even during peak usage.\"},{\"name\":\"Document and Resolve Integration Defects\",\"requirement\":[\"All identified defects must be logged, prioritized, and resolved.\"],\"acceptanceCriteria\":[\"Defects found during testing are accurately logged in the defect tracking system with all necessary details (steps to reproduce, expected/actual results).\",\"Each defect is prioritized based on severity and business impact.\",\"Resolved defects are retested and verified by QA.\",\"Defect resolution rate meets project targets, and critical defects are addressed promptly.\",\"A consolidated defect report is generated showing status and resolution trends.\"],\"description\":\"Systematically document all bugs, errors, and integration issues discovered during testing, facilitate their resolution by development teams, and thoroughly verify fixes to ensure a stable and high-quality integrated system.\",\"userStory\":\"As a Project Manager, I want to track and resolve all integration defects so that the system is stable, production-ready, and meets all quality standards.\"}]","genkit:path":"/{projectGeneratorFlow,t:flow}","genkit:state":"success","genkit:type":"action"},"displayName":"projectGeneratorFlow","instrumentationLibrary":{"name":"genkit-tracer","version":"v1"},"spanKind":"INTERNAL","sameProcessAsParentSpan":{"value":true},"status":{"code":0},"timeEvents":{}}}}
